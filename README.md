# IntelliSenseModelAnalyzer

## Description

A hybrid neural architecture for multimodal fusion, combining graph attention networks with transformers to process visual and linguistic inputs, optimized for explainability via saliency-based feature importance attribution.

## Features

- Here are 7 technical features for the IntelliSenseModelAnalyzer software project:
- "Analyzes neural network models using graphbased algorithms for dependency detection",
- "Supports import and export of models in TensorFlow, PyTorch, and ONNX formats",
- "Performs automated model pruning to reduce computational complexity and improve inference speed",
- "Provides visualizations of model architecture and data flow using interactive graph diagrams",
- "Includes tools for sensitivity analysis and feature importance evaluation",
- "Offers realtime monitoring and alerting for model performance degradation and data drift",
- "Integrates with popular machine learning frameworks for seamless model deployment and integration"
- Let me know if you need any modifications!
